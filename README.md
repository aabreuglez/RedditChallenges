#Learn Java

This repo is dedicated to the challenges that appear on reddit, they help a lot improving the skills.
Thanks to all the community for dessigning such challenges.

Since I'm also learning unit testing I will upload some projects from Netbeans, since Netbeans 8.1 includes JUnit's libraries is the easiest way of being able to
reproduce the test. 

##NOTE: All of these will be done with Java 8
